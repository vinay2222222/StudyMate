# StudyMate
# General Description

StudyMate is an AI-powered academic assistant that transforms static study materials (PDFs, textbooks, lecture notes, research papers) into an interactive Q&A system.
Instead of searching or skimming through hundreds of pages, students can upload documents and simply ask questions in natural language. The system retrieves relevant passages and generates contextual, verifiable answers.

In short: StudyMate turns PDFs into a personal AI tutor.
# Novelty / Uniqueness:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Answers are grounded in the uploaded PDFs, not hallucinated.
Lightweight Hugging Face Models (<3B parameters): Efficient, hackathon-friendly, and usable on modest hardware.
Multi-PDF Support: Can reason across multiple textbooks, papers, or notes in a single query.
Explainable AI: Shows referenced paragraphs so users can verify sources.
Session Transcript: Creates downloadable Q&A logs for exam revision and self-testing.
Student-Centric: Tailored for academic use (concept clarification, viva prep, research support).

# Business / Social Impact:

EdTech companies can integrate StudyMate into learning platforms as a premium “interactive textbook” feature.
Universities can offer it as a digital assistant for online courses, improving student engagement.
Potential SaaS subscription model for students, institutions, or research groups.

# Technology Architecture:

Frontend:
Streamlit (UI for upload, Q&A, history, transcript).

Backend:
PyMuPDF (PDF parsing & text extraction).
SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings.
FAISS (semantic search over chunks).
Hugging Face Transformers (flan-t5-large, bart-base) for LLM-based answers.

Data Persistence:
Session state (Q&A history)
Downloadable transcript (.txt).

Environment:
Python 3.10+
Runs locally or can be deployed to cloud (Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces).

# Scope of the Work:

Core Implementation:
1. PDF ingestion & text cleaning (PyMuPDF).
2. Chunking into overlapping segments.
3. Embedding generation & FAISS index build.
4. Query embedding & retrieval of top-k chunks.
5. Prompt construction & LLM answer generation.
